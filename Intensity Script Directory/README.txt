README instructions for the Python Script named 'Intensity Script.py':

How To Setup: (Needed only once per system setup)
1) Install the application 'Python'
2) Move the 'Intensity Script Directory' folder containing the script to where you would like it in your system
3) Open a Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) window in administrative mode and enter the following lines of code:
- "git clone https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter.git"
- "cd XlsxWriter"
- "python setup.py install"

Use:
1) Inside the 'Intensity Script Directory' folder, replace all files in the 'Inputs' folder with your desired input files of the naming convention 'Xbar.list.txt' where 'X' is any integer.
2) Inside the 'Intensity Script Directory' folder, double click the 'Intensity Script.py' file
3) Inside the 'Intensity Script Directory' folder, the 'Outputs' folder will contain the .xslx file of the results with a date and time stamp


Common Problems:
1) If you're running the script on a new system, ensure you follow the 'How To Setup' instructions above
2) Make sure you follow the 'How to Use' instructions above when running the script
3) Check the version number of python in the 'command prompt' application by typing 'python --version'. Version 3.9.0 was used, so if lower, you may need to download a more recent version of Python.
